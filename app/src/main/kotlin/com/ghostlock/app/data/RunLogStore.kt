/**
 * Where a run's artifacts live: `files/runs/<stamp>/` — the log, the resolved
 * profile, the root script's kernel dumps, and a `meta` line saying how the run
 * ended.
 *
 * Why not the Downloads folder, which is where these used to go: shared storage
 * is reached through MediaStore/FUSE, so written bytes sit in that mount's page
 * cache until write-back. A failed run on this ROM ends with the device going
 * down hard, and a hard restart takes the page cache with it — leaving files
 * whose size was committed and whose content is NUL. A user's report arrived in
 * exactly that shape (three files, correct sizes, zero non-zero bytes), so the
 * one artifact that would have explained the failure was destroyed by the
 * failure. The app's own data directory is not FUSE-backed and its descriptors
 * are the app's to fsync, so a log written here survives the crash it is about.
 *
 * It is also why nothing is written to shared storage at run time any more:
 * every run used to leave a folder behind in Downloads (182 of them on the
 * development device) and nothing ever removed them.
 *
 * The logic takes a root directory rather than a `Context` so the rotation,
 * ordering and interrupted-marking rules are testable on the host; the
 * `Context` overloads are the only Android-facing part.
